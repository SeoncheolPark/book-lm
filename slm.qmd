## Linear Model

-   A **linear model** for a response variable $Y$ postulates that the response is related to the observed values of $p$ explanatory variables $X_1, \ldots, X_p$ via this equation: $$
    Y = X_1 \beta_1 + X_2 \beta_2 + \cdots + X_p \beta_p + e,
    $$ where

-   $\beta_1, \ldots, \beta_p$: (unknown) parameters (**coefficients**)

-   $e$: a random variable (**error**)

-   $X_1 \beta_1 + X_2 \beta_2 + \cdots + X_p \beta_p$: mean structure

-   When $n$ obs $(y_1, \pmb{x}_1), \ldots, (y_, \pmb{x}_n)$ are taken on the response and explanatory variables, the linear model as just defined implied that $$
    y_i = \pmb{x}_i^T \pmb{\beta} + e_i, \quad{} (i=1,\ldots, n)
    $$ where

-   $\pmb{\beta} = (\beta_1, \ldots, \beta_p)^T$ and $e_1, \ldots, e_n$ are $n$ possibly correlated random variables.

-   Using vector and matrix notations: $$
    \pmb{y} = \pmb{X \beta} + \pmb{e}.
    $$

-   $\pmb{e}$: **error vector**

-   $\pmb{\Sigma}$: $\text{Var}(\pmb{e})$

## Spatial Linear Model

-   A **spatial linear model** is defined as a linear model for spatial data for which the elements of $\pmb{\Sigma}$ are spatially structured functions of the data sites

### Spatial Aitken Model

-   The simplest spatial linear model is an extension of the Gauss-Markov model that we call the **spatial Aitken model**: $$
    \pmb{\Sigma} = \sigma^2 \pmb{R},
    $$ where

-   $\sigma^2$: an unknown positive parameter and

-   $\pmb{R}$ is a **known** positive definite matrix whose elements are spatially structured functions of the data sites. We refer to $\pmb{R}$ as the **scale-free covariance matrix** of the observations; in some settings, but not all, it is a correlation matrix.

-   Estimation: **generalized least squares (GLS)**

## A toy example of a spatial Aitken model

Consider four obs located at the corners of the unit square in $\mathbb{R}^2$, ordered such that the first and last obs are located at opposite corners of the square. Suppose that the model for the obs is given by $$
\pmb{R} = 
\begin{pmatrix}
1 & e^{-1} & e^{-1} & e^{-\sqrt{2}}\\
e^{-1} & 1 & e^{-\sqrt{2}} & e^{-1}\\
e^{-1} & e^{-\sqrt{2}} & 1 & e^{-1}\\
e^{-\sqrt{2}} & e^{-1} & e^{-1} & 1
\end{pmatrix}
$$
:::

-   **Symmetric**

-   **Positive definiteness**: the variance of any linear combinations of obs having this cov matrix, expect the trivial linear combination with all coeffs equal to zero.

## Spatial General Linear Model

-   A more flexible spatial linear model

-   $\pmb{\Sigma}$ is not fully specified but is given by a **known** spatially structured, matrix-valued parametric function $\pmb{\Sigma}(\pmb{\theta})$, where $\pmb{\theta}$ is an **unknown** parameter vector.

-   Joint parameter space for $\pmb{\beta}$ and $\pmb{\theta}$ generally taken to be $$
    \{ (\pmb{\beta}, \pmb{\theta}): \pmb{\beta} \in \mathbb{R}^p, \pmb{\theta} \in \Theta \subset \mathbb{R}^m \}
    $$ where

-   $\Theta$: the set of vectors $\pmb{\theta}$ for which $\pmb{\Sigma}(\pmb{\theta})$ is symmetric and positive definite, or possibly some subset of that set.

::: {#rem-Aitken}
A spatial Aitken model is a special case of a spatial general linear model, with $\pmb{\theta} \equiv \sigma^2$ and $\pmb{R}$ not functionally dependent on any unknown parameters.

## A toy example of a spatial Aitken model (2)

$$
\pmb{\Sigma}(\pmb{\theta}) = \sigma^2
\begin{pmatrix}
1 & e^{-1/\alpha} & e^{-1/\alpha} & e^{-\sqrt{2}/\alpha}\\
e^{-1/\alpha} & 1 & e^{-\sqrt{2}/\alpha} & e^{-1/\alpha}\\
e^{-1/\alpha} & e^{-\sqrt{2}/\alpha} & 1 & e^{-1/\alpha}\\
e^{-\sqrt{2}/\alpha} & e^{-1/\alpha} & e^{-1/\alpha} & 1
\end{pmatrix}
$$

The parameter space for $\pmb{\theta} \equiv (\sigma^2, \alpha)^T$ within which $\pmb{\Sigma}(\pmb{\theta})$ is p.d. is $$
\{ (\sigma^2, \alpha) : \sigma^2 > 0 , \alpha >0 \}
$$

Small values of $\alpha$ correspond to weak spatial correlation among the obs, and as $\alpha$ increases the spatial correlation among obs become stronger.
